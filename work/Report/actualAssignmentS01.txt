Well. Since we have used github for our two latest projects, I'm quiet familiar with it. 
First time using github I only used the terminal, our teacher Andreas adviced us to do so. Then we didnt use github for 6 months or so. 
The next project i used the integrated git in intelliJ, which makes merge conflicts waaaaay easier to control in my opinion. 
But for this assignment i've used the terminal, which is good to refresh your memory. And its the first time I use tags in git. Which will be interesting. 


I've never craeted a website before, i did however start using html and css a few weeks before we started the course, so I have a small headstart. 
I've barely touched JS but one alert message. Im looking forward to apply more js on my website. 

So, my TIL this section is probably tags, and with a little headstart, how to seperate JS from html. Also some more css!
