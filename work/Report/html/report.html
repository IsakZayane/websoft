            <h2>S01</h2>
            <p>Well. Since we have used github for our two latest projects, I'm quiet familiar with it. <br /> First time using github I only used the terminal, our teacher Andreas adviced us to do so. Then we didnt use github for 6 months or so. <br />                The next project i used the integrated git in intelliJ, which makes merge conflicts waaaaay easier to control in my opinion. But for this assignment i've used the terminal, which is good to refresh your memory. And its the first time I
                use tags in git. Which will be interesting. <br /> I've never created a website before, i did however start using html and css a few weeks before we started the course, so I have a small headstart. I've barely touched JS but one alert
                message. Im looking forward to apply more js on my website. <br /> So, my TIL this section is probably tags, and with a little headstart, how to seperate JS from html. Also some more css! </p>

            <h3>Q1: Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript?</h3>
            <p>We have used CSS in our android course, which gave me some experience. HTML and javascript are brand new for me, i've barely open the devloper console in a browser. <br/> I have however disabled javascript in the browser a few times, to be
                able to read some articles on certain pages. But the sites tends to fix that 'hack' now. <br/> So I know what CSS is, and how to modify parts, but I'm not a good designer, so front end parts dont get so beautiful. It wasn't so hard to
                understand what HTML was. I knew before that the javascript part is what makes the site 'alive'</p>
            <h3>Q2: Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web development.</h3>
            <p>HTML is used to give a structure to a site, like creating a table or creating places to put text on or make a button. <br/> Then the CSS comes into play to alter the table. It can for example change font type, background colour and style them.
                <br/> Then javascript enters and can for example make a button clickable, to produce something like a duck to move around. </p>
            <h3>Q3: What is your TIL for this course section?</h3>
            <p>My TIL for this section was that github had the possibility to host your site, which is very usefull!! </p>

            <h2>S03</h2>
            <h3>Q1: Do you have any previous experience of client side JavaScript? </h3>
            <p>No i do not have previous experience. As stated in S02, I've never used JS, client or serverside before. I did however enjoy making the duck. <br/> The duck image was 'stolen' from the teachers example repo. </p>
            <h3>Q2: Can you compare and relate the JavaScript language to any other language you know? </h3>
            <p>Of course. It's progamming! I've programmed in Java alot during my time on HKR. We have been using some c/c++ with arduino <br/> So in JS we have the basic statements like if, for, while loops etc. </p>
            <h3>Q3: Describe how you worked with the coding exercise, what grade do you aim for and how did your code turn out to be?</h3>
            <p> As a start i just aimed for grade 3. But I set up a page for flags, to do it later. *UPDATE* I have fullfilled the flag part. I couldnt make it Displayed: none with transition. But im satisfied with the js script thats generic for the flags.</p>
            <p>My TIL for this section is further understanding how CSS and JS can be integrated together. How CSS can be modified through JS</p>

            <h3>Q1: Tell me about your previous experience on node/npm or any equal programming tools.</h3>
            <p>I have never used Node nor npm before. I did however use pip. Which is a package management sytem for Python. It works in a similar fashion. </p>
            <h3>Q2: How do you feel about working with JavaScript, Node and Express</h3>
            <p> I feel that javascript keeps growing on me. Node feels good work with. As we created a restful server with java, this feels waaaaaaaaaay much easier to do. Less code, the understanding gets more obvious with less code. <br/> I really think
                that we should have had this course earlier in the program. It would be better for the students because.. this is fun.</p>
            <h3>Q3: Explain how you did take on the coding assignment, did you have a plan and did it work?</h3>
            <p> Well i didnt really have a plan. I attended the lectures and googled some to get going. The example repo made clear on what to do. </p>
            <h3>What grade did you aim for and was it a difficult level?</h3>
            <p>For this assignment, as the other with multiple grades, i aimed to just start and get a 3. And deal with the grade 4&5 later. I tend to drift away and try to do things I want to do, thats not necessary in the grade part. </p>
            <h3>Q4: What is your TIL for this course section?</h3>
            <p>My TIL was that a restful api is much easier to create with node than with JAVA. </p>

            <h3>Q1: How do you feel about PHP as a programming language?</h3>
            <p>Well... I've seen memes on the internet mocking php, calling it "dead language" etc. My initial thought was: "This language is ugly, whats the deal with the dollar sign...?!?!" <br/> But the language grows on me, and isnt that bad. </p>
            <h3>Q2: Can you compare PHP to other languages you know?</h3>
            <p> Well yes, its still programming. However the $ signs is weird and makes the code weirder. Its also not so smooth to always type the dollar sign over and over.. </p>

            <h2>S07</h2>
            <h3>Try to explain the platform .NET (C#, ASP.NET) to a skilled programmer, but newbie to this Microsoft technology.</h3>
            <p>Dotnet uses a MVC framework. Its used to develop web applications, windows and mobile applications <br/> It is usually written in C# and obvisouly is Object-Oriented Programming. </p>
            <h3>Elaborate by comparing .NET technologies with the other technologies we learned during the course.</h3>
            <p>So i think .net is very confusing. You get smashed with alot of files and it gets confusing as a start. Of course, if you put time into it it wont be as confusing. <br/> I really liked to use Node instead. The initial thought, especially with
                all the generated code you get, is that its similar to Android Studio, when you auto generate code there. <br/> The difference for me tho, is that we had a whole course on Android Studio and you go into it after a while. I would like to
                have a course on .NET to get a grip on it and to be have an easier time playing around. <br/> As a start I wanted to aim for grade 4 or 5. But as the course went on I felt like it would be hard to finish it with both our degree project
                and project in this course. So I have only made grade 3 for this. </p>
            <h3>What is your TIL for this course section?</h3>
            <p>That .NET is very difficult and, atleast in VS code using .NET you dont get so explaining error stacktrace. Which is annoying. </p>
